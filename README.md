# GearUp
[deployed link here]

## Description
My front-end capstone project is a culmination of all we have learned during the first half of my coding bootcamp at the Nashville Software School.

## Background
How many times have you thought about going on a weekend backpacking trip and then felt overwhelmed at the thought of having to figure out everything you need to take? You may even get over that initial hurdle and start making your list, but then you keep thinking of items to add to your list when you are at work or playing with the park with your kids and don’t have your list right there with you and you know you will forget to add that one thing you just thought about? And then despair again - Why does it have to be so difficult to just get out in nature and away from it all or a few days?  

It doesn’t have to be! The GearUp app is here to help make your backpacking dreams come true effortlessly! You can add all your current backpacking gear, list the purpose and details for each and snap, the next time you want to go on a trip, your packing list is ready in a sec!
